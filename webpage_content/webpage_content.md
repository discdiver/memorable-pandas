# Memorable Pandas

## Why Memorable Pandas?
I created Memorable Python to help you learn Pandas faster. Memorable Pandas takes a brain-friendly approach that marries the latest in psychology and education research with the key topics you need to know to use Pandas effectively. 

The interactive content is engaging and designed with how humans actually learn things in mind.

## Is Memorable Pandas For You?
This course is for you if you know some Python and want to learn Pandas or learn it better. If you haven't yet learned Python, check out my [Memorable Python book](https://memorablepython.com).

## Why Pandas?
Pandas is the ideal language to learn for several reasons. It's like a spreadsheet with superpowers.

Pandas is the key library for data science and data analysis in Python. Pandas is in demand. You can see how much interest in it has grown from Google searches and Stack Overlow questions. TK insert.

It's built on the Numpy library (pronounced numb-pie). Pandas is like brain-friendly numpy.  With names for columns and index items, it's much easier to reason about than Numpy.

It integrates beautifully with Scikit-learn, the primary library for machine learning in Python. 

It makes quick visualizations a snap with it's built in MatPlotLib API. It aslo works nicely with Seaborn and Plotly so you can create more advanced visualziations quickly. 

Pandas is especially convenient for working with dates and categorical data.

Overall, Pandas is a super library. Becoming a pro with it is a smart move. üòÄ

## A Course Designed to Help You Learn
This course is built to help you really learn Pandas, not just give you the illusion of learning. 

Research shows it's best to learn something new by first working with a simplified version, even if you don't understand all the nuanced rules.[^1] Consequently, you'll be typing some things you may not understand. That's cool! I'll explain everything you typed. Then, you'll go deeper with the concept.

[^1]: This idea comes from [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719) by David Perkins. Hat tip to [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) creators Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas who introduced me to it. Once you have a year of coding under your belt, their courses can teach you deep learning with Python.

I spiral the content. You won't just see a key concept and then never see it again. You'll revisit concept and syntax in later practice and quizzes. 

I use images to help you anchor the content in your minde.

I strive to provide clear, jargon-free explanations.  If something doesn't make sense, please let me know on [Twitter at discdiver](https://twitter.com/discdiver). 

Communicating a technical concept to someone who doesn't know it is difficult. It's hard to remember what it was like to not know related background information. This accidental assumption that you know related information is referred to as the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge). It is a struggle for a writer to remember what it was like when they were learning the language. I tested this content with new Pandas users to break the curse.

---

I provide content chunked into groups. An ordered, structured approach, with lists, is easier to recall than content strewn about.

Pandas often has more than one way to do something. I judiciously excluded lots of stuff you don't need to know to use Pandas. Many intro books try to be exhaustive and sacrifice memorability.

I sprinkle in several different types of mnemonics throughout the course. A mnemonic is a mental trick you use to help you remember something. They are a pillar of efficient memorization. Acronyms, acrostics, and diddies are three types of memory aids.

- *Acronyms* ‚Äî A word where each letter stands for another word. For example, *NASA* for National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
- *Acrostics* ‚Äî A sentence where the first letter of each word stands for a different word you want to remember. For example, *My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos* for the planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupyter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.
- *Diddies* ‚Äî a rhyme with instructions. For example, to help you learn how to spell words with an *i* and an *e* next to each other, many schools teach the diddy "*i* before *e*, except after *c*". üéµ


Memorable Pandas contains a number of mnemonics ‚Äî some are goofy, some are pretty cool ‚Äî not all will work for you. Not all content has an accompanying mnemonic.  Go forth and make your own. Creating mnemonics makes the content you're learning easier for you to recall. Share them with me and the world on [Twitter at discdiver](https://twittter.com/discidver).

I expose you to key points multiple ways. How often do you remember something the first time you see it? Most people don't (although the chances go up if it's memorable). I help you cement your knowledge with interactive code practice, quizzes, and explanations.

Practice questions have you writing code, beyond the code samples in the course. It sounds funny, but it's true: actually coding is key if you want to learn to code. Students report far more success learning a technology when they actively code with it than when they passively view it. So code! ‚å®Ô∏è

At the end of most chapters I provide prompts for you to use to explain the concepts to others. Teaching someone else ‚Äî either through writing or talking about a topic ‚Äî is a phenomenal way to help you cement your understanding. If you can't explain something simply, you don't really understand it deeply.

Finally, in some chapters I'll subject you to a joke. Laughter helps you improve your mood, which helps you stay positive. And positivity helps you persist.

That's a bunch of ways this course is geared to help you learn. I hope you find them helpful! 

Remember, just reading the material and doing the exercises is not enough if you want to have Pandas skills at your fingertips. Learning takes practicing the content by using it. It can help to write down things that are tricky for you to remember. Memorable Pandas will help you speed your learning as much as possible.
